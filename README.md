# CVSmash

## Overview
CVSmash is a cv improvement website which functions like tinder.
Users can upload a cv which gets rated by others around the world.
Recruiters usually spend 6-8 seconds looking at CVs [https://standout-cv.com/how-long-recruiters-spend-looking-at-cv]. Additionally, they may lack the technical knowledge needed to understand what your skills mean and how they are applicable to the job. This is simulated here by exposing your CV to a variety of users, who may not posses the same background as yours.

## Implementation
The webservice is implemented using Flask [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/] and its accompanying libraries. The front end is taken care of by using Flask's Jinja template engine.

## Important
This is a proof of concept, this does not have the security or full feature set of a commercial product.
